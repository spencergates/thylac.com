    title: "Hangman Web App Written in Elm"
    excerpt: "While working on my current project of learning web development and porting my color-shredder to a web app, I started learning Elm.
    Elm is a purely functional programming language that compiles to Javascript and is used to create high performance scalable web applications.
    
    
    This is the first project I've worked on in Elm through the process of teaching myself web development.
    It is a simple implementation of the game Hangman, where players guess the characters of a word.
    The user may enter their own word or phrase then have another user play,
    or the can generate a random three word phrase from the first chapter of Don Quixote to play by themselves.
    A fun little ascii gallows shows the user their progress towards failure, and the character buttons used to enter guesses change color
    to indicate whether or not the guess was correct.

    
    I wanted to use and learn elm because I had trouble grasping the concepts of functional programming in school. We were taught functional programming by creating an interpreter for our own fucntional programming language. Thats even more of a dive into the deep end than trying to learn Elm!
    After working on this project a reading [this wonderful Elm e-book](https://elmprogramming.com/), I feel like I have gained a solid handle on functional programming and the lambda calculus."
